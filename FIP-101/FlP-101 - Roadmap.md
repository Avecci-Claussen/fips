# FIP-101 Roadmap

## Phase 1: FIP-101 Proposal and Fractal Node Upgrade

### 1. FIP-101 Proposal Initiated (December 9, 2025)

FIP-101 was introduced as a proposal for a standardized, open-source, and permissionless indexing service for Fractal. Its goal is to support the long-term stability, decentralization, and sustainable operation of indexing infrastructure, while preserving network liveness and minimizing impact on existing consensus processes.

### 2. Community Feedback and Proposal Finalized (December 9, 2025 – January 24, 2026)

The proposal was opened to community discussion to gather feedback on the mechanism, incentives, and implementation direction.

Following community feedback and refinement, the proposal framework and core design were finalized in the revised FIP-101 draft. The revised proposal defines the Fractal Standard Indexing Service, including open participation, reward reallocation, non-custodial staking, non-blocking settlement, and progressive activation.

### 3. Development & Preparation for Node Upgrade (January 25 – February 11, 2026)

After the proposal was finalized, the team worked with Fractal mining pools and node operators to prepare and implement the node upgrade required for the FIP-101 consensus change.

### 4. FIP-101 Node Upgrade Activated (February 11, 2026)

On February 11, the Fractal node upgrade activated at block height 1,500,000, enforcing the consensus mechanism change. The adjustment changed block reward distribution from 1:2 (Merged Mining : Permissionless Mining) to 1:1:1 (Merged Mining : Permissionless Mining : Index Mining) and enabled the subsequent reward distribution change.

## Phase 2: Build & Validate

FIP-101 is currently in the core development stage, focused on shipping key components:

1. **Open-sourced lightweight indexer development**

   The team is developing an open-sourced lightweight indexer implementation for Fractal. The goal is to make it easier for third-party operators to run their own indexer and participate in the indexing network.

2. **Staking mechanism development**

   The staking mechanism is being developed to support decentralized participation in Index Mining. This includes stake registration, reward eligibility, operator-staker relationships, and reward sharing logic.

3. **Internal validation**

   Internal validation will test the stability, accuracy, and performance of the lightweight indexer, staking mechanism, and Index Mining reward flow before wider public participation.

## Phase 3: Public Testing

Public testing will be introduced in stages. This phase is expected to begin in late May 2026 and continue for at least 8 weeks, pending development and testing progress.

### Stage 1: Capped Staking with Single Indexer

Public testing will begin with a controlled setup using a single indexer and capped staking participation. This stage is designed to validate the staking flow, reward release mechanism, and user participation process under limited conditions.

### Stage 2: Multi-Indexer Testing (now in progress)

The system will expand to support multiple indexers, allowing third-party indexer participation to be tested in a broader environment. This stage will help validate proof submission, reward competition, and network behavior before the full rollout.

- Continued system optimization based on testing and feedback.

## Phase 4: Full Rollout

### Official Launch of Index Mining and Staking

Following public testing and optimization, FIP-101 Index Mining and staking will be officially launched on Fractal.

- Third-party indexer operators will be able to join permissionlessly.
- Users will be able to participate as stakers.
- Index Mining block rewards will be fully distributed according to the official mechanism.

Detailed rules and final reward distribution arrangements will be announced separately.
